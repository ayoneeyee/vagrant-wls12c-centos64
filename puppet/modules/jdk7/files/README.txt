## README October 10, 2013

Download from Oracle and accept that license agreement.

Make sure that the jdk is named as follows:

jdk-7u40-linux-x64.tar.gz

The download from Oracle, at this writing will be 

jdk-7u40-linux-x64.gz

Just add "tar" to the name via a rename.

If you have a newer JDK, then you will also need to modify the site.pp script to accomodate that change.  I would also check with the git Repository from Edwin Biemond for any refreshes of the jdk module.
